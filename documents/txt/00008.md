With a focus on the analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). CancerFree Biotech is committed to developing a more competitive, personalized anti-cancer drug testing service. Current cancer treatment is based on standard treatment protocols and physician experience, but individual differences make treatment methods work differently for each patient. Through our services, doctors will know the actual effect of drugs on patients' cancer cells, and can further tailor treatment to patients' conditions, reducing the risk of patients trying drugs on themselves and reducing the risk and cost of potentially ineffective drugs.
